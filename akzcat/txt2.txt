Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.
 Their long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, 
 has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.
 Settled life emerged on the 
 subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago
